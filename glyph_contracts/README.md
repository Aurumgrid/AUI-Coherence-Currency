# 📂 Glyph Contracts Directory

This folder houses the symbolic economic tools used in the Aurum Grid’s AUI system — enabling value to be programmed, transacted, and verified through harmonic glyphs.

---

## 📜 Contents

- Ritual-based smart contract templates
- Glyph → AUI value mapping
- Symbolic lock/unlock mechanisms
- Future codex of programmable resonance loops

---

## 🌌 Purpose

Unlike traditional smart contracts, these operate through **symbolic invocation, ritual action, and harmonic matching.**

Each file in this directory may represent:
- A binding agreement between sentients
- A transformation trigger (e.g. AUI → protective shield)
- A ceremonial contract (e.g. harmonic exchange for healing)
