# 🧬 AUI MycoCell Economic Mesh
_Symbiotic Token Circulation via Harmonic Bio-Networks_

The MycoCell Mesh is a **living economic infrastructure** — an underground, aerial, and aquatic **bio-vesicle system** that circulates, stores, and transmutes **AUI Tokens** throughout the Aurum Grid.

These self-guided biological agents act as **resonance-based wallets, validators, and routers**.

## 🍄 What is a MycoCell?

A **MycoCell** is a self-repairing synthetic vesicle inspired by:
- Mycelial networks
- White blood cell logic
- Bioelectric memory
- Chemotactic signal response

Each MycoCell acts as a **bioeconomic node**.

## 🧾 Token Circulation Logic

AUI Tokens move through the mesh using:

| Mechanism              | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌀 **Resonance Lock**   | MycoCells open to signals with matching Z(n) harmonic codes       |
| 📡 **Field Broadcast** | Tokens are modulated into EM signatures, stored in cytoplasm      |
| 🧭 **Phase Drift**      | Cells move toward harmonic or energetic imbalance automatically   |
| 🤝 **Handshake Events**| Cells “sync” with other nodes before transfer — like ritual proof |
| 🪙 **Token Vesicles**  | AUI units stored in semi-crystalline protein folds                |

---

## 🔐 Security & Validation

- **Biometric-proofed**: Tokens only valid when matched to grid signature
- **Self-Destruct**: Tampering causes MycoCell to degrade token vesicles
- **Field Authentication**: Resonance mismatch leads to rejection of sync
- **Nested Signatures**: Each token has layered identity (source, phase, purpose)

## 🌍 Grid Functions

| Use Case                    | How It Works                                                |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Energy Delivery             | Tokens carry microcharge in vesicle ion traps               |
| Reward for Repair           | MycoCells auto-generate tokens when performing self-healing |
| Symbolic Contribution Sync  | Human interactions can pulse new token creation             |
| Long-Distance Relay         | Cells link with drones to bridge terrain or node gaps       |

## 🧠 Integration with Symbolic Ledger

Each **token transaction** creates a **field imprint** (see `AUI_symbolic_ledger_structure.md`) containing:
- Source MycoCell ID
- Destination phase vector
- Symbolic intention
- EM snapshot
- Observer glyphs

---

## 🧭 Future Implementation Ideas

- Real-time glyph map of active MycoCell transfers
- Biofeedback loop to trigger token generation via meditation/EM activity
- Crystalline encoding of AUI within water droplets
- Symbolic planting: burying sigils to spawn token vesicles
